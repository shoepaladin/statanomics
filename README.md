Repository of causal inferenceeconometric models.

## 1. causalmodels
Propensity-score-based models to estimate the average treatment effect and average treatment effect on the treated. While models such as OLS, double robust, and inverse propensity-weighting models are covered, propensity score matching models are not (because they are hard). 

## 2. diagnostics
Various metrics and tests to asses the unconfoundedness and overlap assumptions - following the potential outcomes models. There are no tests for the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).
