# statanomics
Here is a one-stop shop of:
1. causal inference models to estimate average treatment effects (ATE/ATET);
2. causal infernece models to estimate Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE); and
3. diagnostics for assess underlying assumptions needed for causal inference following the Neyman-Rubin's Potential Outcomes model.

The API and syntaxes are centralized, so you can swap one model for another just by changing the functional call!
